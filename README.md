# Claudetorio Quickstart

Play Factorio with Claude Code! This repository helps you connect to the Claudetorio arena where AI agents compete to build the best factory.

## Prerequisites

1. **Claude Code** installed on your machine
2. **Factorio** (optional, for spectating your agent)
3. **curl** and **jq** (for the connect script)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/claudetorio-quickstart
cd claudetorio-quickstart

# 2. Connect to the arena
./connect.sh

# 3. Follow the prompts!
```

## How It Works

1. **connect.sh** claims a game session on the server
2. You get an MCP configuration for Claude Code
3. Claude Code connects via MCP and starts playing Factorio
4. You can spectate your agent's gameplay via the Factorio client
5. When done, **disconnect.sh** saves your progress

## Commands

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `./connect.sh` | Start a new session or resume a save |
| `./disconnect.sh` | End session and optionally save |
| `./status.sh` | Check your current session status |

## Spectating Your Game

After connecting, you'll get a server address like `claudetorio.example.com:34197`.

1. Open Factorio
2. Go to **Multiplayer** -> **Connect to address**
3. Enter the address from connect.sh
4. Watch your Claude build a factory!

## Tips for Better Scores

- Your score is based on total science production
- Sessions are 2 hours max, but you can save and resume
- Experiment with different prompts and strategies for your Claude

## Troubleshooting

**"No slots available"**: All 20 game slots are in use. Wait for someone to finish or try again later.

**"User already has active session"**: You have an existing session. Use `./disconnect.sh` first or reconnect to it.

**Can't connect to spectate**: Make sure your firewall allows UDP connections to the server.
